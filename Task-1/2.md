# 2. Review and practice other commonly used Ubuntu commands related to files, processes, and system monitoring.

### PART 1: FILE & DIRECTORY COMMANDS (Basics → Practical)

### Step 1: Know where you are

```bash
pwd
```

**What it does:**

![image.png](attachment:795f2ba5-5b16-4953-9316-3420cced252c:image.png)

Shows your **current directory** (Present Working Directory).

**Why it matters:**

Linux commands always work **relative to your location**.

---

### Step 2: List files and folders

```bash
ls
```

### Useful variations

```bash
ls -l      # detailed view
ls -a      # show hidden files
ls -lh     # human-readable sizes

```

![image.png](attachment:2ee1aa0c-3413-40e6-b2d9-f3a26387824e:image.png)

**Key things to notice:**

- `d` at start → directory
- at start → file
- `rwx` → permissions

---

## Step 3: Move between directories

```bash
cd /etc
cd ..
cd ~
```

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cd /path` | Go to directory |
| `cd ..` | Go one level up |
| `cd ~` | Go to home directory |

**IMP Points to remember:**

![image.png](attachment:9c2c7937-5df3-4c07-b5b2-789fb24b6016:image.png)

`/etc` stores **system-wide configuration files** that control how Ubuntu and its services behave.

**Mental Model (Very Important):**

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc` | Configuration |
| `/bin` | Essential commands |
| `/usr/bin` | User programs |
| `/var` | Logs & changing data |
| `/home` | User files |
|  |  |

---

### Step 4: Create files and directories

```bash
mkdir testdir
touch file1.txt
```

![image.png](attachment:e58c382d-4784-4f8a-81c3-b8a6ca07bdf6:image.png)

**Explanation:**

- `mkdir` → create directory
- `touch` → create empty file or update timestamp

---

## Step 5: Copy, move & delete

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt
mv file2.txt testdir/
rm file1.txt
rmdir testdir
```

⚠️ **Be careful**

```bash
rm -r foldername
```

Deletes **everything inside** (no recycle bin).

![image.png](attachment:fb0acad8-a29a-4cd5-82dd-7f41bc7f0677:image.png)

---

## Step 6: View file contents

```bash
cat file.txt
less file.txt
head file.txt
tail file.txt
```

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `cat` | Show full file |
| `less` | Scroll (best) |
| `head` | First 10 lines |
| `tail` | Last 10 lines |

---

# ⚙️ PART 2: FILE SEARCH & PERMISSIONS

## Step 7: Find files

```bash
find /etc -name "*.conf"
```

![image.png](attachment:400af74a-c871-4b71-b75f-61e769954145:image.png)

**Meaning:**

- Search **from `/etc`**
- Find files ending in `.conf`

---

## Step 8: Search inside files

```bash
grep "error" /var/log/syslog
```

![image.png](attachment:818e18d2-2c34-4c88-8943-50d376171816:image.png)

**What it does:**

Finds the word **error** inside the file.

Useful:

```bash
grep -i error file.txt   # case insensitive
grep -r error /var/log   # recursive
```

---

## Step 9: Understand permissions

```bash
ls -l
```

Example:

![image.png](attachment:a7b7bbf2-f8ef-4e80-91c9-6c7676077a15:image.png)

```
-rw-r--r--
```

| Position | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | file type |
| 2-4 | owner |
| 5-7 | group |
| 8-10 | others |

---

## Step 10: Change permissions

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

| Number | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | read + write + execute |
| 5 | read + execute |
| 4 | read |

---

# 🔄 PART 3: PROCESS MANAGEMENT (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Step 11: View running processes

![image.png](attachment:bbcaf294-6f7b-4cc6-be27-84c74a0d1eb8:image.png)

```bash
ps
ps aux
```

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ps` | current shell |
| `ps aux` | all processes |

---

## Step 12: Live process monitor

```bash
top
```

![image.png](attachment:333ec169-8f89-4de8-b65a-f7f39251e521:image.png)

or better:

```bash
htop
```

![image.png](attachment:c9384e08-d586-400a-a3c2-2b2affa34591:image.png)

(if installed)

**What to observe:**

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Process ID (PID)

---

### 1. CPU usage (left side)

```
0[|||     ] 6.9%
1[|       ] 0.6%
2[|       ] 0.6%
3[|       ] 1.2%

```

**Meaning:**

- You have **4 CPU cores** (0–3)
- Each bar shows **real-time CPU usage per core**
- Core `0` is doing most work (6.9%)

👉 This is **normal** and very low load.

---

### 2. Memory (RAM)

```
Mem[|||||||||||||||   ] 4.72G/15.5G
```

**Meaning:**

- Total RAM: **15.5 GB**
- Used RAM: **4.72 GB**
- Free RAM: ~10.8 GB

✅ Healthy — plenty of free memory

---

### 3. Swap

```
Swp[                  ] 0K/14.9G

```

**Meaning:**

- Swap exists: **14.9 GB**
- Currently used: **0 KB**

✅ Excellent — system is not under memory pressure

---

### 4. Right side (system stats)

```
Tasks: 220, 929 thr, 105 kthr; 1 running
Load average: 0.55 0.53 0.48
Uptime: 04:50:33
```

### Tasks

- **220 processes**
- **1 currently running**
- Rest are sleeping (normal)

### Load average

```
0.55 0.53 0.48
```

Means:

- Last 1 min: 0.55
- Last 5 min: 0.53
- Last 15 min: 0.48

👉 On a **4-core CPU**, load < 4 is **excellent**

### Uptime

- System has been running for **4 hours 50 minutes**

---

## 🟩 PROCESS LIST (MAIN TABLE)

### Column meanings (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| PID | Process ID |
| USER | Owner |
| PRI | Priority |
| NI | Nice value |
| VIRT | Virtual memory |
| RES | Actual RAM used |
| SHR | Shared memory |
| S | State |
| CPU% | CPU usage |
| MEM% | Memory usage |
| TIME+ | CPU time |
| Command | Program name |

---

### Example (your first row)

```
32835 rohan.matr  R  CPU 6.9  htop
```

**Meaning:**

- PID: 32835
- User: you (`rohan.matr`)
- State: `R` → Running
- CPU: 6.9%
- Command: `htop`

👉 `htop` itself is using CPU because it refreshes live.

---

## 🟨 PROCESS STATES (S column)

| Letter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| R | Running |
| S | Sleeping |
| D | Disk wait |
| Z | Zombie |
| T | Stopped |

Your screenshot:

- Mostly `S` → **Normal**
- One `R` → Currently active

---

## 🟥 MEMORY DETAILS (VERY COMMON CONFUSION)

Example:

```
VIRT: 48.9G
RES: 384M
```

### What this REALLY means:

- **VIRT (virtual)** = memory *address space* (can be misleading)
- **RES (resident)** = real RAM actually used

👉 **Always trust RES**, not VIRT.

---

## 🟪 Notable processes in your screenshot

### `/opt/google/chrome/...`

- Google Chrome
- High **VIRT** (normal)
- Moderate **RES**
- Multiple processes = Chrome architecture

### `avahi-daemon`

- Network discovery service
- Very low resource usage

### `systemd-*`

- Core system services
- Required for OS

---

## ⌨️ USEFUL `htop` SHORTCUTS (TRY THESE)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F6 | Sort (CPU, MEM, PID) |
| F9 | Kill process |
| F5 | Tree view |
| F3 | Search |
| F10 | Exit |

---

## 🧠 HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY (YOUR SYSTEM)

| Resource | Status |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | ✅ Very low usage |
| RAM | ✅ Plenty free |
| Swap | ✅ Not used |
| Load | ✅ Excellent |
| Processes | ✅ Normal |

👉 **Your system is healthy. No issues.**

---

### ONE-LINE SUMMARY

This htop screen shows a healthy Ubuntu system with low CPU load, plenty of free RAM, no swap usage, and normal background processes.

---

---

## Step 13: Kill a process

```bash
kill PID
kill -9 PID
```

| Signal | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `kill` | polite stop |
| `kill -9` | force stop |

---

## Step 14: Run process in background

```bash
sleep 60 &
```

Bring it back:

```bash
fg
```

---

# 📊 PART 4: SYSTEM MONITORING COMMANDS

## Step 15: Disk usage

```bash
df -h
```

Shows disk space.

![image.png](attachment:13e1a7e4-ef1f-4efa-80bb-5c5390c35eff:image.png)

```bash
du -sh foldername
```

Shows folder size.

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Root `/` | ✅ Excellent (11%) |
| Boot | ✅ Safe |
| tmpfs | ✅ Normal |
| Disk risk | ❌ None |

---
