+----------------------------------------------------+
| User Applications (Vim, Docker, Apache, etc.)     |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)                     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.)      |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network)       |  <-- Core of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Peripherals)   |
+----------------------------------------------------+

(a) Hardware Layer

🔹 The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
🔹 The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.
(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

🔹 The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management – Handles communication between systems.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

🔹 A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
🔹 Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
🔹 Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.
(d) User Applications

🔹 End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
🔹 Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.

# C. Linux Distributions

Linux distributions (distros) are different versions of Linux that package the Linux kernel with various software, system utilities, and package managers. Each distro is designed for different use cases, such as personal computing, server management, or security.

Here are some popular Linux distributions:

```graphql
Ubuntu – One of the most beginner-friendly distros, widely used for personal and server use. It has great community support.

CentOS (discontinued, replaced by AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux) – Previously a popular choice for servers, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

Debian – A very stable and reliable distro, often used as a base for other distros like Ubuntu.

Fedora – A cutting-edge distro that introduces new features before they reach RHEL.

Arch Linux – A lightweight, rolling-release distro for advanced users who like customization.

Kali Linux – Designed for cybersecurity and penetration testing.

Alpine Linux – A lightweight, security-focused distro often used in containers.
```

# 04. Setup
# Setup Linux Environment on Windows and MacOS

There are multiple ways to setup a Linux environment on a Windows or Mac machines such as `cloud vm`, `wsl2`, `virtualbox`, `Hyperkit` e.t.c.,. However what I would recommend is using a container as a Linux environment.

Just install Docker desktop, run the below command and create linux container of any distribution without worrying about the cost and connectivity issues.

### Docker Command to Run Ubuntu Linux Container in windows host (Persistent & Long-Term)

- Create a folder with name `ubuntu-data` in your downloads folder.
- Then run the below command in `poweshell` updating your `username`.

```bash
docker run -dit `
  --name ubuntu-container `
  --hostname ubuntu-dev `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  --cpus="2" `
  --memory="4g" `
  --mount type=bind,source="C:/Users/Monica Korla/Downloads/ubuntu-container",target=/data `
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
  -p 2222:22 `
  -p 8080:80 `
  --env TZ=Asia/Kolkata `
  --env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 `
  ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

### Docker Command to Run Ubuntu Linux Container in mac or linux host (Persistent & Long-Term)

```bash
docker run -dit \\
  --name ubuntu-container \\
  --hostname ubuntu-dev \\
  --restart unless-stopped \\
  --cpus="2" \\
  --memory="4g" \\
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/ubuntu-data,target=/data \\
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
  -p 2222:22 \\
  -p 8080:80 \\
  --env TZ=Asia/Kolkata \\
  --env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \\
  ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

## Explanation of Each Parameter

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-dit` | Runs the container in **detached (-d)**, **interactive (-i)**, and **terminal (-t)** mode. |
| `--name ubuntu-container` | Assigns a name to the container for easy management. |
| `--hostname ubuntu-dev` | Sets the container’s hostname. |
| `--restart unless-stopped` | Ensures the container restarts automatically unless manually stopped. |
| `--cpus="2"` | Limits the container to **2 CPU cores**. |

# 5. Package Manager

## 📌 What is a Package Manager?

A **package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software in a Linux system. It ensures that software and its dependencies are managed efficiently.

## 🔍 How Does a Package Manager Work?

1. **Repositories (Repos):**
    - A package manager fetches software from **official repositories (online storage of packages).**
    - Example: Ubuntu gets packages from `archive.ubuntu.com`.
2. **Installing Software:**
    - When you install software, the package manager:
    ✅ Downloads the package from the repository.
    ✅ Resolves dependencies (installs additional required software).
    ✅ Installs and configures the software automatically.
3. **Updating Software:**
    - A single command updates all installed packages to the latest version.
4. **Removing Software:**
    - The package manager also **removes** software cleanly without leaving unnecessary files.

## 📦 Popular Package Managers in Linux

| Linux Distro | Package Manager | Command Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu, Debian | `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) | `sudo apt install nginx` |
| Fedora, RHEL, CentOS | `dnf` (or `yum` for older versions) | `sudo dnf install nginx` |
| Arch Linux | `pacman` | `sudo pacman -S nginx` |
| OpenSUSE | `zypper` | `sudo zypper install nginx` |

## 🌍 How Package Managers Fetch Software from Repositories

A **repository** is a server that stores software packages. When a package manager installs software:

1. It **checks the repository list** (e.g., `/etc/apt/sources.list` in Ubuntu).
2. It **downloads the package** and its dependencies.
3. It **installs and configures the software** automatically.

### 📁 Example of an Ubuntu Repository Entry

```
Types: deb
URIs: <http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/>
Suites: noble noble-updates noble-backports noble-security
Components: main universe restricted multiverse
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg
```

## 🔄 Why Should You Run `apt update` After Installing Ubuntu?

When you install Ubuntu, the packages included in the ISO image might be outdated. Running:

```bash
apt install sudo
sudo apt update
```

✅ Updates the package list from repositories.

Then, to install the latest versions of packages, run:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## 🛠 Essential Package Manager Commands

### **APT (Debian, Ubuntu)**

```bash
sudo apt update         # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade -y     # Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install nginx  # Install a package
sudo apt remove nginx   # Remove a package
sudo apt autoremove     # Remove unused dependencies
sudo apt search nginx   # Search for a package
```

### **DNF (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS)**

```bash
sudo dnf check-update   # Check for updates
sudo dnf update         # Update all packages
sudo dnf install nginx  # Install a package
sudo dnf remove nginx   # Remove a package
```

### **Pacman (Arch Linux)**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu        # Sync and update all packages
sudo pacman -S nginx    # Install a package
sudo pacman -R nginx    # Remove a package
```

### **Zypper (OpenSUSE)**

```bash
sudo zypper refresh     # Refresh package list
sudo zypper update      # Update all packages
sudo zypper install nginx  # Install a package
sudo zypper remove nginx   # Remove a package
```

## 🚀 Best Practices for Using Package Managers

- ✅ **Always update your package list before installing software:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
- ✅ **Use `autoremove` to clean up unused dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt autoremove
    ```
    
- ✅ **Enable automatic security updates (Ubuntu):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
    ```
